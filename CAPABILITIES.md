# InvestorClaw Capabilities

v2.2.2 | Financial Analysis + Data Connectivity | For portfolio owners, advisors, and developers

## InvestorClaw Architecture

InvestorClaw combines three coordinated systems. It uses a deterministic portfolio analysis engine, an LLM synthesis layer, and a data connectivity scaffold.

These systems stay separate by design. The LLM does not perform portfolio math.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONVERSATIONAL LAYER (Agent + Natural Language)             │
│ - Interprets "How am I doing?" → routes to performance()    │
│ - Synthesizes JSON results into advisor-grade narratives    │
│ - Answers follow-up questions ("What does Sharpe mean?")    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ COMPUTATION LAYER (Deterministic Python Pipelines)          │
│ - Fetches live prices (Finnhub, Massive, yfinance)          │
│ - Calculates Sharpe, beta, duration, YTM (no LLM math)      │
│ - Runs Modern Portfolio Theory optimization                 │
│ - Outputs compact JSON (270 positions = 2K tokens)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DATA LAYER (Pluggable Connectors)                           │
│ - CSV/Excel/PDF import (broker statements)                  │
│ - Real-time market data (5 provider integrations)           │
│ - Analyst ratings, news sentiment, Treasury benchmarks      │
│ - FRED economic data, yfinance fallback (unlimited)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Data Connectivity

### Market Data Providers

InvestorClaw uses 5 independent data sources. It fails over automatically when a provider is unavailable.

| Provider | Latency | Coverage | Strengths | Requires API Key |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Finnhub | <100ms | 200K+ tickers | Real-time, analyst data, news | Yes (free tier: 60/min) |
| Massive | 200-500ms | 50K+ tickers | High-quality, real-time | Yes (enterprise) |
| Alpha Vantage | 1-2s | US equities | Reliable, free tier available | Yes (5/min free) |
| yfinance | 2-5s | Unlimited | Free, no limits, complete fallback | No |
| FRED (Federal Reserve) | 200ms | 500K+ economic series | Treasury yields, benchmarks | Yes (free, unlimited) |

Failover order:

1. Try Finnhub (real-time, <100ms).
2. If rate-limited or down, try Massive.
3. If unavailable, use Alpha Vantage.
4. If still no response, fall back to yfinance (always works).
5. For Treasury data, use FRED; fall back to yfinance.

> [!NOTE]
> InvestorClaw provides zero-config fallback to yfinance. Users still get live data with no API keys.

### Portfolio Data Import

InvestorClaw imports portfolio data from multiple formats.

Supported formats:

- CSV (preferred): Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, UBS, E*TRADE export formats
- Excel (.xls, .xlsx): Auto-detected columns (Symbol, Shares, Price, Cost Basis)
- PDF: Broker statements (tabular data extraction)
- JSON: FINOS CDM standard (machine-generated)

InvestorClaw detects formats automatically.

```python
import_format = sniff_format(file_path)
# Detects CSV dialect, Excel sheet structure, PDF tables
# Maps "CUSIP" → "cusip", "Num Shares" → "shares", etc.
```

Example CSV (Schwab export):

```csv
Symbol,Quantity,Price ($),Position Value ($)
AAPL,100,215.50,21550
MSFT,50,415.20,20760
VTI,75,265.30,19897
```

InvestorClaw auto-maps column names to the internal CDM schema.

### Real-Time Price Updates

InvestorClaw supports three update modes.

#### On-demand

Use this mode to fetch the latest prices immediately.

```bash
/portfolio holdings --refresh
# Fetches latest prices immediately
```

#### Cached

Use this mode to reuse prices from the last fetch.

```bash
/portfolio holdings
# Uses cached prices from last fetch (faster, cheaper on API quota)
```

#### Scheduled

Use this mode for background refreshes.

- Zeroclaw daemon can refresh every N minutes.
- Useful for dashboards.
- Not required for CLI.

### News and Sentiment Aggregation

InvestorClaw aggregates news and correlates it to your holdings.

Data sources:

- NewsAPI: 100K+ publishers (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, etc.)
- yfinance: Yahoo Finance news feed

Correlation logic:

```python
def portfolio_news_feed():
  news_items = fetch_news_all_tickers()
  # Filter to portfolio holdings only
  # Tag with sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
  # Score by relevance (0.0–1.0)
  return sorted(news_items, key=lambda x: x.relevance_score, reverse=True)
```

Example:

```json
{
  "headline": "Microsoft announces $10B AI infrastructure investment",
  "source": "Bloomberg",
  "date": "2026-04-18",
  "tickers": ["MSFT"],
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "relevance_score": 0.92,  // high relevance to your MSFT position
  "url": "https://..."
}
```

### FRED Economic Data Integration

InvestorClaw uses FRED data for benchmarks and macro context.

Treasury benchmarks:

```json
{
  "fred_data": {
    "10y_treasury_yield": 4.35,
    "3m_tbill_yield": 5.50,
    "2y_treasury_yield": 4.80,
    "fed_funds_rate": 5.50,
    "unemployment_rate": 3.8,
    "inflation_cpi": 3.2
  }
}
```

Used for:

- Bond yield comparisons (is your 4.0% bond attractive vs. 4.35% Treasury?)
- Risk-free rate (Sharpe ratio calculations)
- Macroeconomic context (recession risk, inflation expectations)

## Configuration and Deployment

### API Key Management

InvestorClaw checks API keys in a fixed order.

#### 1. Shell environment variables

This source has the highest priority.

```bash
export FINNHUB_KEY="pk_live_xxx"
export NEWSAPI_KEY="xxx"
investorclaw holdings  # Uses FINNHUB_KEY
```

#### 2. `.env` file

InvestorClaw checks your home directory next.

```bash
~/.investorclaw/.env
FINNHUB_KEY=pk_live_xxx
NEWSAPI_KEY=xxx
FRED_API_KEY=xxx
```

#### 3. Setup wizard config

InvestorClaw can collect keys during first-run setup.

```bash
investorclaw setup
# Prompts for optional API keys, saves to ~/.investorclaw/config.toml
```

#### 4. Fallback

InvestorClaw still works with no keys.

```bash
# Uses yfinance (unlimited, free, no registration)
investorclaw holdings
```

> [!NOTE]
> InvestorClaw works without any API keys. Users can add keys later to unlock real-time data.

### Deployment Modes

InvestorClaw supports three deployment modes.

#### Single-Investor

This is the default mode.

- Personal laptop, iPad, or home server
- Portfolio CSV in `~/portfolios/`
- Results saved to `~/portfolio_reports/`
- No cloud connectivity required

#### FA Professional

This mode targets advisors.

- Multi-client support
- Compliance-grade audit logs
- Custom branding
- Runs on dedicated server or cloud

#### Zeroclaw

This mode targets edge and Raspberry Pi deployments.

- Lightweight Python runtime on Raspberry Pi
- Offline-capable (yfinance caching)
- Paired with central agent (192.0.2.56)
- No cloud calls unless explicitly configured

## End-to-End Example

InvestorClaw can process a full portfolio workflow in about 3 seconds.

User asks: "I just got my Schwab export. How's my portfolio doing compared to the market?"

InvestorClaw workflow:

1. Data import (CSV parser)
   - Reads `~/portfolios/schwab_2026_04_19.csv`
   - Maps columns: Symbol → ticker, Quantity → shares, etc.
   - Validates 50 holdings found
2. Price fetch (data layer)
   - Tries Finnhub for each ticker (100ms each, cached after 5 min)
   - Falls back to yfinance if rate-limited
   - Builds holdings JSON
3. Analysis (computation layer)
   - Calculates concentration (HHI score)
   - Sector breakdown
   - Beta vs. S&P 500
   - Sharpe ratio vs. benchmark
4. Synthesis (conversational layer)
   - Agent receives compact JSON (holdings + metrics)
   - Constructs response: "Your portfolio is up 8.2% YTD, beating the S&P by 2.1%. Your tech weight (28.5%) is driving outperformance, but concentration risk is moderate (HHI=0.087)."
5. Guardrails (always on)
   - Agent appends: "⚠️ This is educational analysis, not investment advice. Consult a qualified financial professional."

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| Total time | ~3 seconds (2.5s for price fetches, 0.5s for calculation) |
| Data sent to cloud | Only the API calls to Finnhub/yfinance/FRED (ticker symbols only, no account details) |
| Sensitive data handling | Portfolio holdings never leave your machine |

```text
User: "How am I doing?"
  ↓
Agent (conversational): Routes → performance() command
  ↓
Command layer: Executes performance.py
  ↓
  ├─ Data layer: fetch_prices() → Finnhub/yfinance
  ├─ Data layer: fetch_historical() → yfinance
  ├─ Data layer: fetch_benchmarks() → FRED
  ↓
Computation layer: Calculate Sharpe, beta, alpha
  ↓
Output: performance.json (compact, ~500 bytes)
  ↓
Agent (synthesis): Reads JSON, generates response
  ↓
"Your portfolio is up 8.2% YTD, beating the S&P by 2.1%.
 Sharpe ratio of 1.28 suggests good risk-adjusted returns.
 Your tech weight (28.5%) is driving outperformance...
 ⚠️ This is educational analysis, not investment advice."
```

## Privacy and Security

InvestorClaw keeps portfolio analysis local by default.

- No cloud by default: All portfolio math runs locally
- Minimal data transmission: Only ticker symbols sent to data providers (no holdings, no values)
- Encryption: Optional encryption for sensitive config files
- Audit logs: Compliance-grade logging (FA mode)
- FINOS CDM: Industry-standard, privacy-respecting schema

## Further Reading

- [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md): All 15 commands with usage examples
- CONFIGURATION.md: API keys, environment variables, advanced setup
- FEATURES.md: What InvestorClaw does and doesn't do
- MODELS.md: Sharpe ratio, beta, YTM, duration formulas
- DEPLOYMENT.md: Production setup, scaling, multi-user

## Summary

InvestorClaw is a three-layer deterministic + LLM system. The LLM never touches portfolio math.

InvestorClaw encrypts data locally. It produces results that are compact enough to fit in a conversational context window.

InvestorClaw works without any API keys because it can fall back to yfinance. It scales from a laptop to a $10B advisory firm.
