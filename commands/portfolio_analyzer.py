            "example": "If your $2.5M portfolio has $150k in one stock (6%), this may indicate concentration above typical diversification guidelines. An investor might consider whether this aligns with their target allocation."

            "what": "Spreading your money across many different stocks, bonds, and sectors",

            "threshold": "A well-diversified portfolio has 40+ different holdings",
