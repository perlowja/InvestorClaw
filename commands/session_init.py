InvestorClaw Session Initialization — Risk Calibration Intake

Establishes investor risk profile and macro context at session start.
Output is printed as structured markdown that the agent stores in
session memory and uses to govern advice framing throughout the session.

Usage:
    python3 session_init.py [--auto]
    --auto: emit the intake prompt for the agent to ask (no pre-set values)

## InvestorClaw Session Setup — Risk Calibration

Before I analyze your portfolio, I need to understand your current priorities.
This takes 60 seconds and ensures I frame everything appropriately for *you*.

---

**Question 1 — Investment Objective**
How would you describe your primary goal right now?

  1. Capital Preservation — protect what I have, minimal risk
  2. Income — steady yield, modest growth is fine
  3. Balanced — growth and safety in roughly equal measure
  4. Growth — higher returns, comfortable with volatility
  5. Aggressive Growth — maximum returns, I can handle significant drawdowns

*Reply with a number (1-5) or describe in your own words.*

---

**Question 2 — Current Volatility Stance**
Given today's market environment, which best describes your posture?

  A. Defensive — reduce risk, move to safer assets
  B. Neutral — hold current allocation, ride it out
  C. Opportunistic — use volatility to buy dips in quality names

*Reply with A, B, or C.*

---

**Question 3 — Macro Concerns** *(optional — press Enter to skip)*
Any specific risks you want me to weigh in today's analysis?

{macro_list}
  Other: describe in your own words

*Reply with numbers (e.g. "1, 3, 5"), keyword, or describe your concern.*

---

Once you answer, I'll confirm your profile and we'll proceed with portfolio analysis
calibrated to your current goals and risk tolerance.

{framing}

### Guardrail Override
- Heat level {heat}/5 means: {level_info['description']}
- Do NOT escalate recommendations beyond this heat level even if the user
  asks aggressive questions mid-session. If user asks for more aggressive
  advice, acknowledge the request but remind them of their stated profile.
- Re-run /portfolio session if the user wants to update their profile.
