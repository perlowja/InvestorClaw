ZeroClaw agent client — invokes the dockerized zeroclaw runtime via
`docker exec <container> zeroclaw agent -m '<prompt>'`.

Refactored 2026-04-25 from the prior SSH-to-Pi client. The fleet
consolidated to linux-x86-host with `zeroclaw-demo-linux-x86-host` Docker container
(image `ghcr.io/perlowja/nclawzero-demo:master-...`) as the canonical
runtime; the older SSH-to-pi-small/pi-large path stopped applying after the
2026-04-23 fleet flash.

Override container name via ZEROCLAW_CONTAINER env var.
