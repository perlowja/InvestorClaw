OpenClaw agent client — invokes the dockerized openclaw runtime via
`docker exec <container> openclaw agent --agent <id> -m '<prompt>' --json --local`.

Refactored 2026-04-25 from the prior WebSocket-based client. The fleet
consolidated to linux-x86-host with `openclaw-demo-linux-x86-host` Docker container as
the canonical runtime; the older ws://localhost:18789 path was a web UI
endpoint, not the agent message endpoint we expected.

OpenClaw 2026.4.24 requires `--agent <id>`, `--session-id <id>`, or
`--to <E.164>` to disambiguate which agent session a one-shot message
targets. We use `--agent main` (the default agent name across the fleet)
unless overridden by OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID env var.

Overrides:
    OPENCLAW_CONTAINER   — container name (default: openclaw-demo-linux-x86-host)
    OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID    — agent ID to target (default: main)
