- Framework: Properly captures timing, errors, command metadata
- Blocking issue: Network access to gpu-host (192.0.2.96:11434) from mac-dev-host
  - Fix: Either (A) enable network routing from mac-dev-host to gpu-host, or (B) deploy local Ollama on mac-dev-host

   - Implement provider selection in test scenarios

2. **Command Testing Suite**
   - Tier 1 validation (10 fast commands, ~1-2 min per device)
   - Tier 2 validation (10 medium commands, ~3-5 min per device)
   - Tier 3 validation (2 slow commands, ~5-10 min per device)
   - Portfolio requirement handling

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test basic command execution on each device
   - Verify output schema (ic_result envelope)

   - Run full suite on each device, capture timings
   - Calculate p50, p95, p99 latencies
   - Establish memory usage baselines
   - Document per-command-per-device expectations

2. **Watchdog Integration**
   - Monitor against baselines during tests

   - Generate performance reports

3. **Performance Dashboard**
   - Track latency trends over time

- ✅ Multi-device SSH+ZeroClaw working end-to-end
- ✅ All 4 LLM providers integrated and tested
- ✅ All 22 commands tested and passing
- ✅ 6 remediation workflows operational
- ✅ Performance baselines established
- ✅ Contract preservation maintained
- ✅ Full harness run <4 hours
- ✅ 100% parity with v8.0 testing scope

## Questions & Blockers

None currently. All Phase 1-2 infrastructure is in place and tested.

Next phase (Phase 3) will require:
- Access to actual API keys (XAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, TOGETHER_API_KEY)
- SSH access to pi-large and pi-small devices
- gpu-host Ollama instance available (for Gemma testing)

All of these are within the existing infrastructure (NAS, mac-dev-host, pi-small, pi-large).
